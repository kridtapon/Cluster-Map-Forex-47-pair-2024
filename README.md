# Cluster-Map-Forex-47-pair-2024
A cluster map is a visualization tool that groups currency pairs based on their correlations or similarities in behavior over a specified period.
By clustering pairs, traders can:
Identify strong correlations (positive or negative) between currencies.
Spot outliers that may indicate unique trading opportunities.
Optimize portfolio diversification by avoiding overexposure to similar assets.

In Forex, these insights are critical for risk management and strategic decision-making, especially when monitoring a large number of pairs.
